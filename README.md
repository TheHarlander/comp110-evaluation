###Week 16
This week we was talking about the new tasks we will be working on this semester, although I am still catching up on work I will try to keep up to date on the tasks handed out this semester. 
We are also looking at C++ a lot this week as we are starting to transition on it fully from python. Although I am behind on programming compared to everyone else I hope that I can understand everything that is said.

###Week 17
This week was my game design pitch and research into the hardware hacking assignment. We all received our makey makey kits which look super enjoyable to work with and i'm looking forward to creating something crazy.


###Week 18
This was a tough week as there was a lot of programming involved. Learning new C++ features and starting to look at the ways we’d use for our games was very through one ear and out the other. I barely understood anything as I was already behind in programming.

###Week 19
Leaving my controller till the end of the week meant I had to rush a design for it and it turned out very tacky, sellotaping cardboard together and hoping it would stick was the main process I did. But after I created it it actually worked for the gam binding of isaac. The Next day after I had made my controller the buttons had dry so when I would touch the buttons it would not send a current through it so the buttons was useless.


###Week 20
Sitting next to my group in lessons watching what they were doing to try and get a window open in SDL had me confused as I had no clue what was happening and I couldn’t help as I did not know anything. 
My controller had buttons that did not work because of the play doh drying so I knew I would have to wait till the hand in day to put the buttons in.


###Week 21
This week I researched what I was going to do for my agile essay and decided I wanted to do something with Stand up meeting. I also handed in my final controller which I was very disappointed in as I did not put time into the design of it.


###Week 22
This week we looked at what we were going to do over the easter holidays. Also we had a guest come in to look at our research questions, my final research question is now going to be “How different types of stand up meetings affect stress and workload perception”.I also spent the majority of this week finding papers and websites for reading material on this question. 

###easter
This easter I dedicated my time to working on my agile essay as I failed the last one. For the first week I looked at all my references to get a general feel on what i should write about, taking notes of pages for reference to important parts. I then wrote out a plan for my essay, and spent time each day after that chipping away at the workload.


###Week 23
This week we looked at our git branches and how we could improve them for our game. I also looked at what component I wanted to do for my coding task 2 which was the mushroom/endgame for the game. I was proud of the work ethic i had when i was at home maybe because i did not need to worry about my mum as i was with her but since I have been back I’ve stopped doing work each day and nearly reverted to my old ways and everything seems more difficult again.


###Week 24
Finishing up on the little bits for my essay i was pleased at what i’ve done compared to my last essay. I also sat down with my group while they went through what they have done for the game and explained it for me.


###Week 25
This week I felt like i was on top of the essays we had due. Each day I was around my friends house as she had work to do I was just on my laptop and managed to finish the semester review, heuristics essay and the team review.

###Week 26
After people reviewing my work i worked on amending the mistakes before the handin.


###Week 27
This week was very painful for me as I thought that we only had a week to do the worksheets as I have only completed one of 7. This halted my work on other tasks as I just couldn’t get my head around how much work I have to do. On the thursday i found out i actually had 2 weeks to do them so i was very relieved but then realised i had a few days to do my coding task 2. I spent around 6-7 on saturday working on my mechanic because i couldn't get my head around how to do it then the next day i went on skype with sam and she told me what i should do and had did the most part of what she did but put it in the wrong place.

###Week 28
This week we looked at our coding task 2 posters but mine was atrocious compared to the others as I did not know what to do for it and it was nowhere near the quality it should be. We aksi had our programming vivas where we showed off our group projects. I also have spent the whole week nearly each day doing worksheets for the handin. It was tiring but I managed to do 5 out of the 7 and get the pass mark for these worksheets.
